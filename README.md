This application was a collaboration with a team of developers to build and deploy a full application in two weeks where users can search for Magic: The Gathering cards, build digital decks, and interact with other users and their decks. We operated with the Agile Scrum procedures to manage and use time constraints to our benefit. This application implemented persistent storage using the CRUD methods with multiple RESTful APIs including Google Maps, MongoDB and Scryfall.
